# My NHL Projects to demonstrate my programming skills

Welcome to my repository! Here, I have shared two small projects demonstrating my work in computer vision and deep learning for NHL Stenden university of applied sciences and Computer Vision & Data Science (Master).

## **1. [Simple Lane Detector][1]**

This project implements a basic lane detection system using image processing techniques. It demonstrates:
- Reading and preprocessing images.
- Identifying lane markings in road images.
- Overlaying the detected lanes on the original image.

### Key Features:
- Easy-to-understand code for beginners.
- Uses OpenCV for image processing.

## **2. [GTSRB Sign Recognition][2]**

This project implements a paper focused on traffic sign recognition using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. It includes:
- Preprocessing of the GTSRB dataset.
- Training a deep learning model for sign classification.
- Achieving successful implementation and recognition of traffic signs.

### Highlights:
- Faithful reproduction of the paper's methodology.
- Robust traffic sign recognition with high accuracy.
